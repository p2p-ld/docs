# Definitions

Putting there here to remind me to use the glossary directive... (these are not real definitions yet, just placeholders)

```{glossary}

Identity
    A unique cryptographic identity. One person may have multiple identities. One identity may have one or several {term}`Petname`s and {term}`Beacon`s

Petname
    A short name used to refer to a {term}`Identity`. Petnames are always contextual: `@Alice` referring to `@Bob` has the status of "The person that @Alice knows as @Bob." A petname can be declared by the identity being referred to as a "canonical" petname, but since they are potentially nonunique they should always be dereferenced against the Identity making the reference.
