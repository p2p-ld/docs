While the intentions of this trend are not new, the topic gained traction due to technological advancements, most notably blockchain networks. As a consequence, we observe that a new generation of peer-to-peer data networks emerges. In this survey paper, we therefore provide a technical overview of the next generation data networks. We use select data networks to introduce general concepts and to emphasize new developments. Specifically, we provide a deeper outline of the Interplanetary File System and a general overview of Swarm, the Hypercore Protocol, SAFE, Storj, and Arweave. We identify common building blocks and provide a qualitative comparison. From the overview, we derive future challenges and research goals concerning data networks.},

Scholars increasingly use scientific and cultural assets in digital form, but choosing which among many objects to cite for the long term can be difficult. There are few well-defined terms to describe the various kinds and qualities of persistence that object repositories and identifier resolvers do or don’t provide. Given an object’s identifier, one should be able to query a provider to retrieve human- and machine-readable information to help judge the level of service to expect and help gauge whether the identifier is durable enough, as a sort of long-term bet, to include in a citation. The vocabulary should enable providers to articulate persistence policies and set user expectations.},

Whereas it is commonly admitted that BitTorrent performs well, recent studies have proposed the replacement of the rarest first and choke algorithms in order to improve efficiency and fairness. In this paper, we use results from real experiments to advocate that the replacement of the rarest first and choke algorithms cannot be justified in the context of peer-to-peer file replication in the Internet.},

Analyzing heterogeneous datasets and additional derived data requires rigorous tracking of their interrelationships and provenance.

Adherence to these principles is necessary for proper stewardship of information, for testing regulatory compliance, for measuring the efficiency of processes, and for facilitating reuse of data-analytical frameworks.},

Datasets can be multi-homed such that if the original source goes offline clients can choose to automatically discover additional sources. As data is added to a Dat repository, updated files are split into pieces using Rabin fingerprinting and deduplicated against known pieces to avoid retransmission of data. Dat Streams are automatically verified using secure hashes mean- ing data is protected against tampering or corruption. Dat guarantees privacy if the Dat Link is kept secret, but does not provide authentication of sources, only authentication of data.},

  abstract = {The most pressing problems in science are neither empirical nor theoretical, but infrastructural. Scientific practice is defined by coproductive, mutually reinforcing infrastructural deficits and incentive systems that everywhere constrain and contort our art of curiosity in service of profit and prestige. Our infrastructural problems are not unique to science, but reflective of the broader logic of digital enclosure where platformatized control of information production and extraction fuels some of the largest corporations in the world. I have taken lessons learned from decades of intertwined digital cultures within and beyond academia like wikis, pirates, and librarians in order to draft a path towards more liberatory infrastructures for both science and society. Based on a system of peer-to-peer linked data, I sketch interoperable systems for shared data, tools, and knowledge that map onto three domains of platform capture: storage, computation and communication. The challenge of infrastructure is not solely technical, but also social and cultural, and so I attempt to ground a practical development blueprint in an ethics for organizing and maintaining it. I intend this draft as a rallying call for organization, to be revised with the input of collaborators and through the challenges posed by its implementation. I argue that a more liberatory future for science is neither utopian nor impractical -- the truly impractical choice is to continue to organize science as prestige fiefdoms resting on a pyramid scheme of underpaid labor, playing out the clock as every part of our work is swallowed whole by circling information conglomerates. It was arguably scientists looking for a better way to communicate that created something as radical as the internet in the first place, and I believe we can do it again.},

Public sparql endpoints aim to fulfill that need, but their availability is notoriously problematic. We therefore introduce Linked Data Fragments, a publishing method that allows efficient offloading of query execution from servers to clients through a lightweight partitioning strategy. It enables servers to maintain availability rates as high as any regular http server, allowing querying to scale reliably to much larger numbers of clients. This paper explains the core concepts behind Linked Data Fragments and experimentally verifies their Web-level scalability, at the cost of increased query times. We show how trading server-side query execution for inexpensive data resources with relevant affordances enables a new generation of intelligent clients.},
