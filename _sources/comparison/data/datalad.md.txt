# DataLad

DataLad is a tool for managing datasets! It is built on top of {index}`git` and {index}`git-annex <git; annex>` for storage, and is capable of integrating with external hosting providers (through git annex)

It has a number of interesting extensions that we can learn from 
- [crawler](https://docs.datalad.org/projects/crawler/en/latest/) allows you to archive web pages
- [OSF Remote](https://github.com/datalad/datalad-osf/blob/main/datalad_osf/annex_remote.py) - example of an extension for interacting with OSF
