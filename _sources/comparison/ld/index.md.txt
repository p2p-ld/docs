Linked data was born to be p2p. Many of the [initial, lofty visions](https://jon-e.net/surveillance-graphs/#semantic-web-priesthoods) of the [semantic web](https://jon-e.net/infrastructure/#linked-data-has-an-ambivalent-history-of-thought-regarding-the-l) are only possible with p2p systems - fluid, languagelike ontologies, portable personal data, truly decentralized information structuring on the web and so on {cite}`saundersSurveillanceGraphs2023,saundersDecentralizedInfrastructureNeuro2022`. That's one of the central goals of this project --- as might be obvious from its placeholder name: p2p-ld.

Don't just take my word for it tho:

> So, where does this leave us? We have seen a lot of resources being put into publishing Linked Data, but yet a publicly widely visible “killer app” is still missing. The reason for this, in the opinion and experiences of the authors, lies all to often in the frustrating experiences when trying to actually use Linked Data for building actual applications. Many attempts and projects end up still using a centralized warehousing approach, integrating a handful of data sets directly from their raw data sources, rather than being able to leverage their “lifted” Linked Data versions: the use and benefits of RDF and Linked Data over conventional databases and warehouses technologies, where more trained people are available, remain questionable. {cite}`polleresMoreDecentralizedVision2020`
