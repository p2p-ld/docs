> There are three kinds of information that need to be discovered about an entity:
>
> - its basic identity (type and/or category)
> - the features it offers and protocols it supports
> - any additional items associated with the entity, whether or not they are addressable as JIDs
>
> All three MUST be supported, but the first two kinds of information relate to the entity itself whereas the third kind of information relates to items associated with the entity itself; therefore two different query types are needed.
